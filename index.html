        <p>1. In Blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and having a higher total than the dealer. If you bust (exceed 21), you lose. The dealer also plays, and their hand is revealed after all players have made their decisions. </p>
        <p>2. Card Values: 
        Cards 2-9 have their face value. 
        10, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10. 
        An Ace can be 1 or 11, whichever is most beneficial to the player. </p>
        <p>3. Initial Deal:The dealer deals each player two cards face up, and deals themselves two cards, one face up and one face down. </p>
        <p>4. Player's Turn: Players decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (stop taking cards).If a player busts, they automatically lose. </p>
        <p>5. Dealer's Turn:After all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals their face-down card. 
        The dealer follows specific rules for hitting or standing (usually outlined by the casino). 
        <p>6. Payouts:Player Wins: If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, they win. 
        Dealer Busts: If the dealer busts, all players who haven't busted win. 
        Push: If the player and dealer have the same total, it's a push (tie), and the bet is returned.</p>
